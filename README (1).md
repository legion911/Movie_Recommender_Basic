# Movie Recommendation System 
## About

In this incredibly busy society, people are constantly pressed for time. Everyone prefers making decisions from options that are accessible with a single click when it's time for a little break to clear their minds. What could be better than a user being suggested their favourite song to play or a quick movie to view while taking a break? It's true that recommendation engines also understand your viewing habits and could provide content suggestions based on the time of day or your habits. Without having to hunt through the extensive content catalogue, the recommender system enables users to select their favourite films fast on the home screen.

## Function

Based on consumers' past viewing habits and preferences, intelligent algorithms used in movie recommender systems make movie suggestions for them to watch. These systems employ information from user ratings, reviews, and viewing patterns to analyse data and produce suggestions that are unique to each user. The invention of the movie recommender system has completely changed how people find and watch films by making it easier for viewers to find specific films within enormous film libraries.

## Similarity ratio

Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.

Jaccard Similarity is a common proximity measurement used to compute the similarity between two objects, such as two text documents. Jaccard similarity can be used to find the similarity between two asymmetric binary vectors or to find the similarity between two sets.

The Dice similarity coefficient, also known as the Sørensen–Dice index or simply Dice coefficient, is a statistical tool which measures the similarity between two sets of data. This index has become arguably the most broadly used tool in the validation of image segmentation algorithms created with AI, but it is a much more general concept which can be applied to sets of data for a variety of applications including NLP.
