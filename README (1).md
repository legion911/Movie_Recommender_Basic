## About

In this incredibly busy society, people are constantly pressed for time. Everyone prefers making decisions from options that are accessible with a single click when it's time for a little break to clear their minds. What could be better than a user being suggested their favourite song to play or a quick movie to view while taking a break? It's true that recommendation engines also understand your viewing habits and could provide content suggestions based on the time of day or your habits. Without having to hunt through the extensive content catalogue, the recommender system enables users to select their favourite films fast on the home screen.


## Function

Based on consumers' past viewing habits and preferences, intelligent algorithms used in movie recommender systems make movie suggestions for them to watch. These systems employ information from user ratings, reviews, and viewing patterns to analyse data and produce suggestions that are unique to each user. The invention of the movie recommender system has completely changed how people find and watch films by making it easier for viewers to find specific films within enormous film libraries.
