# Movie_Recommender_Basic

Objective - To design a recommendation system based on movies which would analyze the past preferences of the user concerned, and then would use this information to try to find similar movies.

Recommendation System - Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

Purpose - The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual.

A movie based recommender system is a software tool that suggests movies to users based on their personal preferences. It uses algorithms & machine learning to analyze data points, such as a user's previous movie choices & ratings, to generate personalized recommendations.
