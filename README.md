# Movie_Recommender_Basic

In this incredibly busy society, people are constantly pressed for time. Everyone prefers making decisions from options that are accessible with a single click when it's time for a little break to clear their minds. What could be better than a user being suggested their favourite song to play or a quick movie to view while taking a break? It's true that recommendation engines also understand your viewing habits and could provide content suggestions based on the time of day or your habits. Without having to hunt through the extensive content catalogue, the recommender system enables users to select their favourite films fast on the home screen.

Based on consumers' past viewing habits and preferences, intelligent algorithms used in movie recommender systems make movie suggestions for them to watch. These systems employ information from user ratings, reviews, and viewing patterns to analyse data and produce suggestions that are unique to each user. The invention of the movie recommender system has completely changed how people find and watch films by making it easier for viewers to find specific films within enormous film libraries.

Objective - To design a recommendation system based on movies which would analyze the past preferences of the user concerned, and then would use this information to try to find similar movies.

Recommendation System - Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

Purpose - The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual.

A movie based recommender system is a software tool that suggests movies to users based on their personal preferences. It uses algorithms & machine learning to analyze data points, such as a user's previous movie choices & ratings, to generate personalized recommendations.
